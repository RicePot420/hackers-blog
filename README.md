# Introduction

## **Making a virtual machine**

I started with making a virtual machine using Kali Linux with I learned to be a sufficent OS to use for ethical hacking, cyber security, etc. (Link below)

In the past I have used Virtual Box and Vmware and for this I was thinking of going with VMware Workstation because I am more familiar with it.
I have also found these following resources to teach ethical hacking and cyber security ----

With further research I also found an image that is ready to use on Vmware. I downloaded the image off of Kali's website.
